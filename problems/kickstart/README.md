# Kickstart

## [Google Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart)

All problem sets include a link to the problem's description and analysis
(i.e. official solution). Plenty of problems are solved, plenty are unsolved,
and some haven't even been attempted yet, either because they sounded boring
or the solution wasn't obvious and I decided I had no time for them.

In my opinion, the most elegant problems from 2018 are Cave Escape(3) and
Funniest Word Search(3). From 2019 are Contention(3) and Energy Stones(2).
