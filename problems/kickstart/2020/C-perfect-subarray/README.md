## [Perfect Subarray (10pts, 19pts)](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/000000000019ff43/00000000003381cb)

Solved. Implicit (recursion) prefix/suffix sum tree.
The number of squares in the range [0, 10^7] is small enough (3200)
to allow for this method.

* Time: 75 minutes
* Complexity: O(S N log N), where S is the number of squares
* Memory: O(S + N)
