# Kickstart 2016 - Sorting Array

## [Sorting Array (13pts, 27pts)](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/0000000000201ca0/0000000000201ca1)

Solved

For every range X[L..R] (there are N^2 such ranges) determine if [L..R], when
sorted, contains only consecutive integers (e.g. [A..B]) and if so, determine
its shift (e.g. `A-L`) which is the movement along X that puts it in the correct
sorted position.

This can be achieved in `O(N^2)` time and space.

* Time: 11 hours
* Complexity: O(N^2)
* Memory: O(N^2)
