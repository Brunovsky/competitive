# LeetCode - medium

## [79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search)

Solved.
This is probably an NP-complete problem, but the tricky cases
(e.g. chess-like boards and words) are never exercised in LeetCode's test cases,
so dumb naive DFS solutions like this one get through in mere milliseconds.

* Complexity: O(4^W)
* Memory: O(W)
